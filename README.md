# Store Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for my store performance prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict the performance of various stores based on a comprehensive dataset that includes store location, product assortment, promotions, and historical sales data. I used various machine learning algorithms, conducted feature engineering, and evaluated model performance to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 85%.

## Data Collection
I collected a comprehensive dataset that includes information on store location, product assortment, promotions, and historical sales data. This dataset serves as the foundation for my predictive models.

## Data Preprocessing
I conducted thorough data preprocessing and cleaning, handling missing values and outliers to ensure the dataset was ready for model training.

## Model Development
I implemented various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to build predictive models. I used the scikit-learn library to train and evaluate the models, leveraging techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.

## Feature Engineering
Throughout the model development process, I conducted feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and improve the model's predictive performance. This involved transforming and creating new features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis of the data.

## Model Evaluation
I evaluated model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 85%, demonstrating the efficacy of the model in predicting store performance.

## Results Visualization
To present the results, I created visualizations and generated interactive dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly. These visualizations showcased the predicted performance of different stores, identifying areas of improvement and enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
